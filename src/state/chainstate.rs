//! Chainstate manager for validation and chain state management.
//!
//! The [`ChainstateManager`] is the central component for:
//! - Processing and validating blocks
//! - Reading block data from disk
//! - Querying the active chain and block tree
//! - Managing chainstate databases
//!
//! # Example
//! ```no_run
//! # use bitcoinkernel::{Context, ChainType, ChainstateManager, KernelError};
//! #
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), KernelError> {
//!     let context = Context::builder().chain_type(ChainType::Regtest).build()?;
//!
//!     let chainman = ChainstateManager::builder(&context, "./data", "./blocks")?
//!         .chainstate_db_in_memory(true)
//!         .build()?;
//!
//!     chainman.import_blocks()?;
//!
//!     # let block = unimplemented!();
//!     chainman.process_block(&block);
//!
//! #     Ok(())
